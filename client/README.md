# Supervisor Notification Module
# Author: Alex Rios
This project is a simple front-end supervisor notification form.
I used routes and context for easier scalability and maintenance
The project is already built and final files are in the build folder
However, if any changes are made then it will have to be built again

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
This will install all the dependencies requires to run the app

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode on port 3000

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
